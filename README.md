# Web Scraping 

Interactive dashboard that displays charts and text from a JSON file. View the final product [here](https://klbowman.github.io/microbiome-dashboard/).

## Description

This repository is designed to visualize taxonomic data using charts, and display metadata in an organized panel. The [data](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/results-and-data/) comes from a study that sequenced the microbiome of 153 human belly buttons (Hulcr et al., 2012), and is stored in the samples.json file. Individual samples are identified by a numerical code and accompanied by metadata including age, gender, ethnicity, etc. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) id numbers and counts are provided for each sample.

The dashboard includes a drop-down menu that displays the numerical code for each individual sample. When a sample is selected, the “Demographic Info” panel is populated with metadata and the following three charts are populated with data:
* Bar graph displaying the top 10 OTUs by count
* Gauge plot showing the belly button scrubs per week
* Bubble plot displaying OTU counts for the entire sample
